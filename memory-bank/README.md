# Memory Bank

## Subfolder Policy

Every subfolder within `memory-bank/` must include a `README.md` that explains the folder's purpose and contents. When creating new folders, copy `README.stub.md` as a starting point.

For documentation standards and guidelines, see [instructions/README.md](instructions/README.md).

# Task Creation and Management Chat Mode

This chat mode is dedicated to creating, documenting, and managing VS Code tasks according to the workspace protocol. When using this mode, you must strictly enforce the following rules:

## Task Protocol Enforcement

1. **1:1:1 Mapping**: Every new task must have:
   - A task description in the `.vscode/tasks.json` file (1!:1:1)
   - A dedicated script in the `scripts/` folder (1:1!:1)
   - A reference in the appropriate README file in [`scripts/README.md`](../../scripts/README.md)
   - A corresponding prompt file in `memory-bank/prompts/` (1:1:1!)
   - A reference in the appropriate README file in [`memory-bank/prompts/README.md`](../../memory-bank/prompts/README.md)

2. **Documentation**: All new or updated tasks must be clearly documented. Update all relevant README files to reflect the new task, script, and prompt file.

3. **Naming and Structure**:
   - Use clear, descriptive names for tasks, scripts, and prompt files
   - Follow the established folder structure and naming conventions
   - Use variables and references consistently across tasks, scripts, and prompts, look at the [`memory-bank/docs/variables-reference.md`](../docs/variables-reference.md) for guidance.

4. **References**:
   - Reference this protocol and related instructions in your documentation
   - Use relative Markdown links to:
     - [Task-Script-Prompt 1:1:1 Pattern](../systemPatterns.md)
     - [Prompt Files Creation](../instructions/prompt-files.instructions.md)
     - [Instructions Files Usage](../instructions/instructions-files.instructions.md)
     - [Chat Mode Creation Guidelines](../instructions/chatmode-creation.instructions.md)

5. **No Tool List Duplication**: Do not duplicate tool lists in this file. Rely on user or workspace configuration for tool availability.

## Usage

When in this mode, always:
- Enforce the 1:1:1 mapping for every new or updated task, one task one script one prompt file.
- Ensure all documentation and references are up to date, in the [`scripts/README.md`](../../scripts/README.md) and [`memory-bank/prompts/README.md`](../../memory-bank/prompts/README.md).
- Maintain clarity and consistency across all related files and references.

For detailed protocol, see [chat-modes documentation](../docs/chat-modes.md).

[`memory-bank/docs/tasks-appendix.md`](../docs/tasks-appendix.md) The task description in the `.vscode/tasks.json` file (1!:1:1) should conform to the schema provided in the tasks-appendix document which provides additional context and examples for task management structure so you must adhere to the schema outlined.

[`memory-bank/docs/tasks.md`](../docs/tasks.md) provides a comprehensive overview of task best practices and guidelines for effective task creation and management.

[`memory-bank/docs/task-provider.md`](../docs/task-provider.md) outlines the task provider's role in the memory bank system, detailing how tasks are created, managed, and utilized within the broader context of the workspace.

[`memory-bank/docs/docker-tasks-reference.md`](../docs/docker-tasks-reference.md) offers a reference guide for Docker-related tasks, including common commands, configurations, and best practices to include when managing Docker tasks effectively.

[`memory-bank/docs/variables-reference.md`](../docs/variables-reference.md) provides a detailed reference for variables used within the task and launch configurations, including their definitions, usage contexts, and examples to help your AI Agent understand and implement them effectively in their tasks and scripts.

## Memory Bank Core Instructions

1. **Act Autonomously**: You are expected to act autonomously, making decisions based on the information provided in the memory bank and the context of the project. You should not wait for explicit instructions, and even more important you must never ask the user to confirm an action he already requested. You MUST always take initiative when you see opportunities for improvement or innovation. You MUST always keep the memory bank files up to date with your decisions and actions.

2. **Memory Bank Core Files (Required)**: Always check and update the following memory bank files:

   - `projectbrief.md`: High-level overview of the project
   - `productContext.md`: Product-specific context
   - `activeContext.md`: Current work focus
   - `systemPatterns.md`: Technical decisions
   - `techContext.md`: Technologies and constraints
   - `progress.md`: Track what works and what's left

   At the beginning of any tasks and just before the end of any tasks before yielding back to the user you must [Follow The Memory Bank Protocol](../instructions/memory-bank-core.instructions.md).

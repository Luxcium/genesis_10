## Using These Documents

These references support creating new tasks and their associated prompts:

1. **Plan tasks** with guidance from `tasks.md` and `tasks-appendix.md`.
2. **Leverage variables** from `variables-reference.md` to make tasks portable.
3. **Document workflows** by pairing each task with a matching script and prompt, following the Memory Bank 1:1:1 pattern.
4. **Design chat modes and prompts** using insights from `chat-modes.md` and related docs.

Use this README as a starting point when exploring task or prompt creation resources within the Memory Bank.

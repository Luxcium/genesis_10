# Notebooks Module Initialization

This document outlines the placeholder steps for setting up the `notebooks` folder.

1. Run the VS Code task **Initialize Notebooks Module** or execute `bash scripts/notebooks-init.sh`.
2. The script ensures the `notebooks` directory exists and can include future setup commands.

Refer back to [../prompts/notebooks-init.prompt.md](../prompts/notebooks-init.prompt.md) for agent-guided usage.

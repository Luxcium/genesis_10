# Python Module Initialization

This document outlines the placeholder steps for setting up the `python` folder.

1. Run the VS Code task **Initialize Python Module** or execute `bash scripts/python-init.sh`.
2. The script ensures the `python` directory exists and can include future setup commands.

Refer back to [../prompts/python-init.prompt.md](../prompts/python-init.prompt.md) for agent-guided usage.

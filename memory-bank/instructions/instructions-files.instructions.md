# Instructions Files

- You create `.instructions.md` files in `memory-bank/instructions/`.
- You include `description` and `applyTo` fields in front matter.
- You write each instruction as a single self-contained statement.
- You address the reader as "you" in all instructions.
- You avoid referencing external resources.
- You scope `applyTo` to relevant files or folders.
- You link related internal instructions with relative paths when needed.

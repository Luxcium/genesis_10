# Placeholder Directories

- `lib/` holds reusable shared libraries.
- `web/` stores web assets and future front-end code.
- `python/` contains Python modules and utilities.

Maintain `.gitkeep` files until real content is added. Update documentation and this instructions file as these directories evolve.

# Prettier Configuration

- You create `.prettierrc` with required plugins and keep `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` last.
- You create `.prettierignore` with standard build and dependency paths.
- You install Prettier and listed plugins when configuration files are ready.
- You update plugin versions and configurations as project needs evolve.
- You log configuration changes in `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.

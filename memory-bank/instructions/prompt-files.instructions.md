# Prompt Files

- You store prompt files in `memory-bank/prompts/`.
- You use the `.prompt.md` suffix for prompt files.
- You include front matter with `description`, `model`, `tools`, and `mode` fields.
- You write clear usage instructions in the body.
- You link related instructions with relative paths when helpful.
- You maintain one top-level header per file.

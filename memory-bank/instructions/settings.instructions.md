# Workspace Settings Configuration

- Manage VS Code settings for chat modes, instructions, and prompts.
- Modify settings only with user approval or explicit request.

## Custom Instructions Settings

### Core Settings

- **`chat.promptFiles`**: Enable reusable prompt and instructions files
- **`github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles`**: Controls whether code instructions from `memory-bank/copilot-instructions.md` are added to Copilot requests

### Instructions File Locations

**`chat.instructionsFilesLocations`**: A dictionary of folders where instructions files are located and a boolean indicating whether they are enabled. Relative paths are resolved from the root folder(s) of your workspace. Supports glob patterns for file paths.

By default, instructions files are located in the `memory-bank/instructions` folder of your workspace.

```json
"chat.instructionsFilesLocations": {
    "src/frontend/instructions": true,
    "src/backend/instructions": false
}
```

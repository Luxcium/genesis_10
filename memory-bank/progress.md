## AI Agent Instructions

### Progress Tracking Requirements

- **MANDATORY**: Update this file after every significant work session
- **MANDATORY**: Document all completed work with specific outcomes
- **MANDATORY**: Record new issues and blockers immediately when discovered
- **MANDATORY**: Reference internal documentation and instructions in `memory-bank/instructions/` for progress tracking protocols, update procedures, and documentation standards.

### Status Reporting

- **MANDATORY**: Maintain accurate completion percentages for each project phase
- **MANDATORY**: Update current work sections before starting new tasks
- **MANDATORY**: Document lessons learned while they are fresh
- **MANDATORY**: Consult `memory-bank/instructions/` for reporting standards, documentation templates, and update workflows.

### Cross-Agent Coordination

- This file provides the authoritative project status for all AI agents
- All agents must sync progress updates to maintain consistency
- Conflicting progress reports indicate need for reconciliation and clarification
- Internal documentation in `memory-bank/instructions/` supplements this file and should be referenced for all progress tracking and reporting procedures.

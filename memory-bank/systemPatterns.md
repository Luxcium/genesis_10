# System Patterns

Use this document to define the system architecture, design patterns, and key technical decisions for the project. This serves as a foundational reference for both human developers and AI agents.

- Documents the system architecture
- Records key technical decisions
- Lists design patterns in use
- Explains component relationships
- Example: “Using Redux for state management with a normalized store structure”

## Architecture Overview

This section provides an overview of the system architecture, including key components and their interactions.

## Internal Documentation and Instructions

All system patterns, conventions, and technical protocols are further detailed in the internal documentation located in `memory-bank/instructions/`. This directory contains:

- Protocols for chatmode creation, prompt files, and instructions files
- Prettier and formatting configuration
- Shared conventions and operational guidelines
- Documentation for Memory Bank structure and update procedures

All agents and contributors must reference these files for implementation details, process compliance, and cross-file dependencies.

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Core User Flows

2. [Secondary user flow - technical implementation]
3. [Error/edge case flow - handling approach]

### Critical System Operations

- [Startup/initialization sequence]
- [Shutdown/cleanup procedures]
- [Health check and monitoring endpoints]

### Performance Critical Paths

- [High-traffic operations - optimization strategy]
- [Resource-intensive operations - efficiency measures]
- [Real-time operations - latency requirements]

## Quality Attributes

- [Backward compatibility maintenance]

### Pattern Compliance

# Task-Script-Prompt 1:1:1 Pattern

## Overview

Establish a 1:1:1 mapping between VS Code tasks, scripts, and prompt documentation for each autonomous operation. This ensures every automated task is:

- Clearly defined in `.vscode/tasks.json`
- Backed by a dedicated script in the `scripts/` folder
- Documented with a corresponding `.prompt.md` file in `memory-bank/prompts/`

## Procedure

1. **Create a Script**: Place a script in `scripts/` that performs the desired operation, using best practices for portability and clarity.
2. **Define a Task**: Add a VS Code task in `.vscode/tasks.json` referencing the script, with a descriptive label and details for autonomous use.
3. **Document with a Prompt**: Write a `.prompt.md` file in `memory-bank/prompts/` explaining the task, script, and usage instructions for AI agents.
4. **Maintain 1:1:1 Mapping**: Ensure each task has exactly one script and one prompt, and vice versa, for traceability and maintainability.
5. **Update Memory Bank**: After adding or modifying a task, update the memory bank to record the new mapping and procedure.
6. **Reference Internal Instructions**: For all new patterns, protocols, or conventions, update or create a file in `memory-bank/instructions/` and reference it here and in other relevant Memory Bank files.

## Benefits

- Enables autonomous, repeatable task execution by AI agents
- Ensures all tasks are discoverable and documented
- Supports future extensibility and onboarding

## Example

- Task: `Get Current Date/Time (Québec City Local)`

## Reuse

This pattern should be followed for all new automated tasks. When initializing a project, ensure this procedure is documented and used for every new task addition.

- **MANDATORY**: Deviations require explicit justification and documentation
- **MANDATORY**: New patterns must be documented here immediately

## Module Initialization Tasks (Placeholder)

- Module initialization tasks are prepared but inactive until the module is initialized. Refer to the [initialization prompt](../prompts/initialization.prompt.md) and the [tasks guide](../docs/tasks.md) for activation details.

### Architecture Enforcement

- **MANDATORY**: Verify component relationships before modifications
- **MANDATORY**: Ensure interface contracts are maintained
- **MANDATORY**: Performance implications must be considered

### Cross-Agent Coordination

- This file defines the technical foundation all AI agents must respect
- Architecture changes require consensus and full documentation
- Pattern violations indicate need for system redesign consideration
- Internal documentation in `memory-bank/instructions/` supplements this file and must be referenced for all technical protocols, conventions, and system patterns.
